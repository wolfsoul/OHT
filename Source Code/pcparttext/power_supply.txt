			<div class="entry">
			<p>A power supply unit (PSU) is the component that supplies power to the other components in a computer.
			More specifically,
			a power supply unit is typically designed to convert general-purpose
			alternating current (AC) electric power from the mains 
			(100-127V in North America, parts of South America, Japan, and Taiwan; 
			220-240V in most of the rest of the world) to usable low-voltage 
			direct current (DC) power for the internal components of the computer. 
			Some power supplies have a switch to change between 230 V and 115 V. 
			Other models have automatic sensors that switch input voltage automatically,
			or are able to accept any voltage between those limits.
			The most common computer power supplies are built to conform to the ATX form factor.
			This enables different power supplies to be interchangeable with different components inside the computer.
			ATX power supplies also are designed to turn on and off using a signal from the motherboard, and provide support 
			for modern functions such as the standby mode available in many computers. The most recent specification of 
			the ATX standard PSU as of mid-2008 is version 2.31.
