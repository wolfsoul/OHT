			<div class="entry">
				<p>A monitor or display (sometimes called a visual display unit) is an electronic visual display for computers. 
				The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry, and an enclosure.
				The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor 
				liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) thin panel,while older monitors use a cathode ray tube about as deep as the screen size.
				Originally computer monitors were used for data processing and television receivers for entertainment;
				increasingly computers are being used both for data processing and entertainment. 
				Displays exclusively for data use tend to have an aspect ratio of 4:3 those used also (or solely) for entertainment are usually 16:9 widescreen.
				Sometimes a compromise is used, e.g. 16:10.<br/></p>
